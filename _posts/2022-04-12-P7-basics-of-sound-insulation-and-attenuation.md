## Sound Attenuation vs Insulation

| Situation | Difference | Equation |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Sound Attenutation | Source and receiver are within the same volume | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79191009/162873100-aa181f9b-0334-41c3-9c9e-5d60ca639296.png) |
| Sound Insulation | Source and receiver are within different enclosures | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79191009/162875779-e76f868d-5c1d-49d7-be84-cb31f901659d.png) |
| Standardized Sound Insulation | Sound level difference to which a weighting term taking into account the reverberation time *T* of the room, as compared to a reference reverberation time *T_0*. Most commonly requirements books and regulations. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79191009/162876640-f4904995-bc2f-42c3-ba6c-de5769e92055.png) |

## Sound Reduction Index (*R*)

> *Sound reduction index* is the acoustic characteristic of a wall or floor for sound reduction purposes.

- *R* is independent of the room and envelope characteristics
- *R* is determined through lab measurements
- Under specific condition, *R* can be computed (predicted) with limited accuracy

## Sound Transmission Paths

1. Direct transmission.
2. Flanking transmissions through the various constructive elements linked to the separating wall.Such flanking uses coupling coefficients, <img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79191009/162877510-d897ed1c-4286-4b77-b6da-fcd8dfe9a7a4.png" width = "40" height = "40">. (ISO 12354)
3. Leakage around some construction elements.
4. Secondary transmissions by means of duct layouts.

## Common Sound Insulation Ranges and Values

| Situation | Range (dB) | Remarks |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| Between offices with removable partitions | 25-35 | 30 dB is considered by several standards for two of the same kind of activities to be carried out in two adjacent rooms. |
| Between doctor office and waiting room | 40-50 | 45 dB is considered by several standards to be the minimum sound insulation value required to allow privacy between two adjacent rooms. |
| Between modern dwellings | 50-55 | Usually is the range required by most regulations. |
| Between cinema theatres | 65-70 | Usually is the range required by the background noise levels targeted by the standards of the industry. |
