## 1.0 Sources of Building Vibration
- Mechanical equipment 
- Users' equipment 
- Rail transportation corridor nearby 
- People walking or dancing 
- Wind on the façade or roof 

## 2.0 Relevant Standards and Regulations
- Standards of noise exposure experienced steady development over the years, but standards on vibration exposure are not that obvious due to lack of data for the subject matter 
- Excessive vibration levels are usually covered due to risk of building structural safety, aspects covering annoyance are not as complete 
- ISO 2631: Considers three vibration spectral limits (comfort, work efficiency & danger) with the highest sensitivity in 4 - 8 Hz interval 
- Noise generated by vibrations are usually regulated using the ***L_{Aeq,1h,max}*** indicator 

## 3.0 Vibration Control
### 3.1 Source Reduction
- Minimizing the vibratory energy generated by a source through better design or resilient decoupling from the structure 
- The most efficient, but the hardest (almost impossible) way, especially rehabilitation projects 
- Causes interruption of equipment operation 

### 3.2 Path Reduction
- Implementing expansion joints along the propagation path 
- Tricky, hard to consider all the potential problems (especially propagation underground) 
- For vibrations are mainly propagated on surfaces, vibration barrier might be useful, as long as, no nearby hard surfaces (reflect vibration causing short-circuit for the barrier) 
- For vibrations across building, control measures between foundations and superstructure is possible with springs or resilient elements (close cooperation between structural, acoustic, safety & fire engineer required)

### 3.3 Receiver Reduction
- Box-in-box construction 
- Rooms protected by concrete slab supported with resilient pads or springs 

## 4.0 Vibration Generated Noise
- Vibrating surface will radiate a sound power level, usually, in the low frequency range 
- Noise radiation will appear well before any vibratory sensation 
- Sound power level, ***L_w***, radiated by a wall of surface, ***S***, excited by vibrations can be expressed as:

Where:
- ***σ***: the radiation factor of the wall 
- ***L_v***: velocity level reference 10^(-6) m/s [dB] 
- ***K***: constant 
- ***P***: perimeter of the surface 
- ***f_g***: coincidence frequency 
- ***E***: Young's modulus [N/m^2] 
- ***d***: thickness of the plate [m] 
- ***ρ***: the volumetric mass of the material 
- ***µ***: transversal compressibility coefficient 

The radiation factor, ***σ***:

- Examples of ***10 log(σ)*** values:   
i. 24 cm brick wall: 0 dB   
ii. 7 cm concrete: Range (-15 to -5 ) dB until 500 Hz, then 0 dB above   
iii. 13 mm plasterboard: Range(-15 to -5) dB until 2000 Hz, then 0 to 5 dB above
