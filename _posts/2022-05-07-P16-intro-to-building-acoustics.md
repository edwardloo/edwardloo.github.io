# Building Acoustics
## Background on Building Acoustics
### Definition
  > "***Building acoustics*** (a.k.a architectural acoustics) is the science and engineering of achieving a good sound within a building and is a branch of acoustical engineering." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_acoustics)

### Purpose of Building Acoustics
  - To protect occupants from exterior noise and vibration aggressions
  - To ensure proper sound insulation between building spaces
  - To control reverberation inside building spaces
  - To control noise from building mechanical equipment into building spaces
  - To control noise radiated to environment from building mechanical equipment of human activities

### Basics of Incident Sound on Materials
Generally, when an sound wave impinges onto a material, the incident sound waves would be:
  
  - [Reflected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics)) (defined by ***ρ***)
  - [Transmitted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_transmission) (defined by ***τ***)
  - [Absorbed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(acoustics)) (defined by ***α***)

Which resulted in the following relationship:

Some common notions on sound transmission through materials:
  - The coefficients are **frequency dependent**
  - The higher the frequency of interest, the lower the ***transmission coefficient, τ***
  - Soft and porous materials will have higher ***absorption coefficient, α*** at higher frequency of interest

### Common Areas in Building Acoustics
  - Sound Insulation
  - Impact Noise
  - Acoustic Absorption and Reverberation Time
  - Vibration Control
  - Construction Noise
  - Stages of Building Construction
  - Refurbishment
  - Sound Masking
  - Privacy and Security
  - Room Acoustics
